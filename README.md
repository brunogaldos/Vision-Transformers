# Vision Transformer (ViT) for Image Classification

## Overview
This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of a **Vision Transformer (ViT)** for image classification, based on the [Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/pets/). Vision Transformers apply the principles of transformer models, originally used for NLP, to computer vision tasks, enabling them to process image data in a novel and effective way.

In this implementation, we preprocess images from the Oxford-IIIT Pet dataset and feed them into a Vision Transformer for classification.

## Requirements
To run this project, you will need to install the following Python packages:
- `torch`: PyTorch deep learning framework.
- `torchvision`: For datasets and image transformations.
- `einops`: For tensor manipulations, used in rearranging tensor dimensions.
- `matplotlib`: For visualizing images.

You can install the required dependencies via pip:
```bash
pip install torch torchvision einops matplotlib
```

## Dataset
We utilize the Oxford-IIIT Pet dataset, which consists of images of 37 breeds of pets. The dataset includes a variety of images with multiple classes, making it a great test case for image classification models.

You can download the dataset through `torchvision.datasets` as follows:
```python
from torchvision.datasets import OxfordIIITPet
from torchvision.transforms import Resize, ToTensor
dataset = OxfordIIITPet(root='data', download=True, transform=ToTensor())
```

## Model Architecture
### Vision Transformer (ViT)
The Vision Transformer (ViT) applies the transformer architecture to image data by splitting the input image into patches, linearly embedding each patch, and then applying self-attention mechanisms across the patches.

Key components of the ViT model:
- **Image Patching**: Images are split into smaller patches, each treated as a sequence element.
- **Linear Embedding**: Each patch is linearly embedded into a fixed-dimensional space.
- **Positional Encoding**: The model adds positional information to each patch, enabling it to learn spatial dependencies.
- **Transformer Layers**: The core transformer model is used to process the embedded patches and extract relevant features.

### Transformer Encoder
The transformer encoder layer uses self-attention to compute relationships between patches and extract global information across the entire image.

## Visualizing Image Patches
The transformer processes images as patches.
